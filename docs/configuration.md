# Vela configuration

Most user-facing settings should be changed through **Vela Settings**. This document describes the files and environment variables behind those controls, plus development/debug overrides that are intentionally kept out of the main README.

## Persistent compositor settings

The compositor stores non-display settings in:

```text
~/.config/vela/vela.conf
```

or, when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set:

```text
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vela/vela.conf
```

The format is intentionally simple:

```ini
# comments begin with #
key=value
```

Vela Settings preserves unrelated lines when it updates a key and asks the compositor to reload the file. Boolean values are `yes` or `no` (`1` and `true` work too).

### `vela.conf` keys

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `language` | system | Interface language: `it`, `en`, or empty to follow the system (Italian if the system is Italian, English otherwise). |
| `screen-off` | `10` | Minutes of inactivity before the idle action. `0` disables it. |
| `lock-on-idle` | `yes` | Lock before turning displays off. |
| `keyboard-layout` | system/default | Comma-separated XKB layouts, for example `it,us`. |
| `keyboard-variant` | empty | Comma-separated XKB variants matching `keyboard-layout`. |
| `keyboard-options` | empty | XKB options. |
| `keyboard-repeat-delay` | `400` | Key-repeat delay in milliseconds. |
| `keyboard-repeat-rate` | `30` | Key repeats per second. |
| `night-light` | `no` | Enable Night light. |
| `night-light-strength` | `48` | Night-light strength, 0–100. |
| `night-light-schedule` | `no` | Night-light schedule: `no`, `sunset` or `hours`. |
| `night-light-from` | `21:00` | Manual Night-light start time. |
| `night-light-to` | `07:00` | Manual Night-light end time. |
| `color-filters` | `no` | Enable the color filter. |
| `color-filter` | `grayscale` | `grayscale`, `deuteranopia`, `protanopia` or `tritanopia`. |
| `color-filters-shortcut` | `no` | Allow Super+Ctrl+C to toggle color filters. |
| `magnifier-step` | `100` | Magnifier step in percent. |
| `sticky-keys` | `no` | Sticky modifier keys. |
| `tearing` | `yes` | Allow fullscreen apps that explicitly request tearing. |
| `variable-refresh` | `games` | VRR policy: `no`, `games` or `always`. |
| `mouse-speed` | `10` | Pointer speed, 1–20. |
| `mouse-precision` | `yes` | Pointer acceleration / enhanced precision. |
| `mouse-primary-button` | `left` | Primary mouse button: `left` or `right`. |
| `mouse-scroll-lines` | `3` | Scroll lines per wheel notch. |
| `touchpad` | `yes` | Enable touchpad input. |
| `touchpad-with-mouse` | `yes` | Keep the touchpad enabled when a mouse is connected. |
| `touchpad-speed` | `10` | Touchpad pointer speed, 1–20. |
| `touchpad-tap` | `yes` | Tap to click. |
| `touchpad-natural-scroll` | `yes` | Natural scrolling. |
| `touchpad-three-fingers` | `app` | Three-finger gesture mode: `app`, `desktop` or `no`. |
| `touchpad-four-fingers` | `desktop` | Four-finger gesture mode. |

The Settings app is the preferred way to edit these values because it applies validation and reloads the compositor at the correct time.

## Display configuration

Persistent display layout is stored separately in:

```text
~/.config/vela/outputs.conf
```

Each physical display gets its own section identified from make, model and serial when available:

```ini
[Vendor Model Serial]
enabled=yes
mode=2560x1440@180.000
scale=1.25
rotation=normal
position=0,0
```

Supported rotation names are `normal`, `90`, `180`, `270`, `flipped`, `flipped-90`, `flipped-180` and `flipped-270`.

Files written before October 2026 used Italian names (`schermi.conf`, and Italian keys and values in `vela.conf`). Vela still reads them and rewrites them with the English names.

Normally this file should be managed through **Settings → Displays** rather than edited by hand.

## Runtime environment variables

These are useful for one-off overrides, nested sessions, experiments and troubleshooting.

### Display and input

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `VELA_SCALE` | Force output scale. A single value applies to all outputs (`1.25`); per-output values can be supplied as `DP-1=1.5,HDMI-A-1=1`. Without it, Vela chooses a scale from each monitor's DPI. |
| `VELA_OUTPUT_SIZE` | Resolution/refresh for nested or headless outputs, for example `1920x1080@144`. |
| `VELA_NATURAL_SCROLL=0` | Force classic touchpad scrolling; this override wins over the stored natural-scrolling setting. |
| `XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT` | Initial keyboard layout, for example `it`. |
| `VELA_TERMINAL` | Terminal launched by Super+Enter. Default: `konsole`. |

### Presentation, VRR and power

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `VELA_VRR=1` | Force VRR always on where supported. |
| `VELA_VRR=0` | Force VRR off. |
| `VELA_TEARING=0` | Disable tearing even for applications that request it. |
| `VELA_SCANOUT=0` | Disable direct scanout. Useful for A/B comparisons and debugging. |
| `VELA_READY_WAIT=0` | Apply app commits immediately even if the app's GPU has not finished drawing the buffer, so frames wait for it. Only for comparison: by default commits wait for their fences and the screen never waits for an app. |
| `VELA_LATCH=0` | Disable late latching and render when the backend frame event arrives. |
| `VELA_LATCH_MARGIN` | Minimum late-latching safety margin in milliseconds. Default: `1`; the frame clock can grow the effective margin after late frames. |
| `VELA_REALTIME=0` | Disable realtime scheduling for the compositor main thread. |
| `VELA_SCREEN_OFF` | Override idle timeout in minutes. Default is 10 if no stored setting exists; `0` disables idle screen-off. |
| `VELA_LOCK_ON_IDLE=0` | Turn displays off on idle without locking first. |
| `VELA_LOCK` | Use another locker instead of `vela-lock`, for example `swaylock`. |

### Appearance and shell integration

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `VELA_WALLPAPER` | Override the wallpaper image. SVG, PNG, JPEG and other supported formats can be used. |
| `VELA_ICON_THEME` | Fallback icon theme when Qt cannot resolve one. Default: `breeze-dark`. |

## Development and renderer diagnostics

These variables are for diagnosis rather than normal user configuration.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `VELA_STATS=1` | Print per-output FPS, frame cost, draw-to-light latency and missed vblanks every two seconds. |
| `VELA_VULKAN_VALIDATION=1` | Enable Vulkan validation layers. |
| `VELA_DEBUG=1` | Enable verbose wlroots logging. |
| `VELA_DEBUG_SCANOUT=1` | Log why a fullscreen surface is not eligible for direct scanout. |
| `VELA_DEBUG_DAMAGE=1` | Force full-output damage every frame, bypassing normal damage reduction for diagnosis. |
| `VELA_DEBUG_SYNC=1` | Make the CPU wait for the GPU on every renderer submission; useful when isolating synchronization problems. |
| `VELA_DEBUG_LINEAR=1` | Force linear render buffers instead of normal tiled/modifier allocation; useful for allocator/modifier diagnosis. |
| `VELA_DEBUG_INPUT=1` | Enable the virtual keyboard/pointer protocol used by `vela-input`. Off by default for security. |
| `VELA_FILES_TIMING=1` | Make `vela-files` print startup timing data; used by `scripts/measure.sh`. |
| `VELA_SHOT_OUTPUT` | Select which output `vela-shot` captures by zero-based index. |

## Internal variables

The supervisor, session launcher and test harness also use internal variables such as `VELA_WAYLAND_SOCKET_FD`, `VELA_WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `VELA_START_LOCKED`, `VELA_RESTARTED`, `VELA_BUILD` and `VELA_TEST_MARK`.

They are implementation details, are not intended as stable user configuration, and may change without notice.

## Examples

Run Vela nested at 1440p/180 Hz with 125% scale:

```sh
VELA_OUTPUT_SIZE=2560x1440@180 VELA_SCALE=1.25 sh scripts/run-nested.sh
```

Compare composited fullscreen rendering against direct scanout:

```sh
VELA_SCANOUT=0 VELA_DEBUG_SCANOUT=1 sh scripts/run-nested.sh
```

Run with Vulkan validation and renderer statistics:

```sh
VELA_VULKAN_VALIDATION=1 VELA_STATS=1 sh scripts/run-nested.sh
```

Force full damage while diagnosing rendering artifacts:

```sh
VELA_DEBUG_DAMAGE=1 sh scripts/run-nested.sh
```
