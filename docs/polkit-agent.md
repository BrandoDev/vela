# The polkit agent

Design of Vela's own polkit authentication agent: the dialog that asks for an
administrator password when an app or a command needs one (`pkexec`, `run0`,
renaming the PC, changing the date, mounting a disk...). It replaces KDE's
agent (`plasma-polkit-agent.service`). This document comes before the code:
decisions are made here, and the code follows them.

> **Status:** design approved (§2). Stages **P0–P3 are done** (§11): the
> agent, the dialog, `Vela.Controls` and the compositor changes, with their
> tests (§10). Next: P4, trying it in the real session.

## 1. Goals

1. **It looks like Windows 11's User Account Control.** The whole desktop
   dims and blurs, and a single dialog in the middle asks the question. It
   says who is asking and what for. Nothing else can be clicked until the
   user answers.
2. **It is always correct about the session.** It registers for the
   session Vela is running in. That also holds when Vela is started from a
   TTY while Plasma is running on another console.
3. **It costs nothing while idle.** The agent runs all day and is needed a
   few times a week. The process that stays alive has no Qt, no QML and no
   GPU context.
4. **Requests never get lost or refused.** Two requests at the same time are
   queued and shown one after the other, as on Windows. A request withdrawn
   by polkit disappears, whether it is on screen or still waiting.
5. **It can be tested without touching PAM.** Wrong passwords sent to the
   real PAM stack can lock the user's account (`pam_faillock`, see
   [testing](testing.md)). The tests never get anywhere near it.

## 2. Decisions taken

| Decision | Choice | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Look | **UAC-like, full screen**: dimmed and live-blurred desktop, modal dialog | layer-shell overlay surfaces on every output (§6.1) |
| Processes | **two**: `vela-polkit-agent` (always running, no GUI) and `vela-polkit-prompt` (Qt Quick, one per request) | they talk over a pipe with lines of text (§5) |
| Who starts the agent | **the compositor, as a supervised child**, like `vela-shell` | it inherits the logind session (§4.1); no systemd unit |
| Language | **C++**, like the rest of Vela | no Rust: it would bring no real security gain (the password is typed in the Qt prompt anyway) and would add a second toolchain |
| polkit library | **libpolkit-agent-1 directly** (GLib), not polkit-qt6 | polkit-qt6's `cancelAuthentication()` doesn't say *which* request is cancelled. KDE's agent therefore refuses a second request while one is open. With a `GCancellable` per request we can queue (§4.3) |
| Shared QML | a new **`Vela.Controls`** module (Theme, buttons, text fields, blur) | used by the prompt first, then by the shell, Settings and Files (§8) |
| Tests | the prompt is driven **by the test itself**, which plays the agent; the agent's core runs on a **fake backend**, the whole agent against a **fake polkitd** | no polkit and no PAM in automated tests (§10) |

## 3. Overview

```
polkitd (system bus)
   │  BeginAuthentication / CancelAuthentication (D-Bus)
   ▼
vela-polkit-agent ──── PolkitAgentSession ────► polkit-agent-helper-1 ──► PAM ("polkit-1")
   │        (via /run/polkit/agent-helper.socket, or the setuid helper)
   │ fork + exec, two pipes (§5)
   ▼
vela-polkit-prompt (Qt Quick, layer-shell overlay) ──► the compositor
```

- `vela-compositor` starts `vela-polkit-agent` and restarts it if it crashes.
- `vela-polkit-agent` registers with polkitd for the current session.
  - For each request it picks the identity and runs a `PolkitAgentSession`.
  - It starts one `vela-polkit-prompt` and passes the PAM conversation
    through to it.
- `vela-polkit-prompt` draws the dimmed screens and the dialog. It sends back
  what the user types, then fades out and exits.

## 4. `vela-polkit-agent`

A small C++ program on GLib/GIO. It subclasses `PolkitAgentListener`
(`initiate_authentication` / `initiate_authentication_finish`); GObject
boilerplate is kept to one file. Qt is not linked.

### 4.1 Registration

- Subject: `polkit_unix_session_new_for_process_sync(getpid())`.
  - The process is a child of the compositor, so it is inside the compositor's
    logind session: the one SDDM opened, or the TTY's.
  - A systemd user service would be outside every session. polkit would fall
    back to the user's "display" session, which is Plasma's when Vela is tried
    from a TTY.
  - If logind can't name the session, `XDG_SESSION_ID` is used.
- Object path: `/org/vela/PolkitAgent`.
- **Another agent already registered for this session:** registration fails.
  The agent logs it and exits with a distinct code (2). The compositor does
  not restart it in that case, to avoid a restart loop.
- **polkitd restarted:** libpolkit-agent-1 doesn't re-register by itself.
  The agent watches the `org.freedesktop.PolicyKit1` name owner and registers
  again when it comes back.

### 4.2 A request

`initiate_authentication(action_id, message, icon_name, details, cookie,
identities, cancellable)`:

1. **Identity.** Among `identities` (unix users; groups are already expanded
   by polkit):
   - the current user if present, with no choice shown, as on Windows;
   - otherwise the first one, and the prompt shows a picker. `root` goes
     last.
   - Display name: from the GECOS field, falling back to the login name.
   - Avatar: the same source as vela-lock
     (`/var/lib/AccountsService/icons/<user>`, then `~/.face.icon`).
2. **Who is asking.** polkit puts `polkit.subject-pid` and `polkit.caller-pid`
   in `details`.
   - The agent resolves the subject pid (falling back to the caller pid) to a
     program from `/proc/<pid>/exe`, and to an installed app (`.desktop`
     entry) whose `Exec` runs it. Shells and interpreters (`sh`, `python3`...)
     never match an app by themselves; then the script in their arguments is
     tried. With no app, the name the program was started with is shown
     (`run0`, not `systemd-run`).
   - For `pkexec` the program to run (`program` detail) counts, not the shell
     that started `pkexec`.
   - That gives the name and icon shown at the top of the dialog ("Do you
     want to allow *Settings* to make changes to your device?").
   - For `pkexec` the `command_line` detail is shown under "Show more
     details". For `run0` and other systemd actions, the `unit` and `verb`
     details are shown there.
   - *To verify on the real polkit 127: which `polkit.*` details actually
     arrive.*
3. Start the prompt (§5), then a `PolkitAgentSession` for the chosen identity.
4. Pass the session's signals through to the prompt:
   - `request(text, echo)`, `show-error(text)`, `show-info(text)`;
   - `completed(gained)`.
5. **`completed(true)`:** the agent tells the prompt `done` and completes the
   request.
6. **`completed(false)`:** a finished `PolkitAgentSession` can't be reused,
   so a new one starts for the same identity.
   - If the user had answered, the answer was wrong: the prompt gets `retry`.
     Retries have no limit; only the user's "No" ends the request.
   - If not, the session ended by itself (the helper doesn't start, PAM
     refuses at once). It is tried once more, silently; a second time the
     prompt gets `failed` and says authentication isn't available, instead
     of looping.
   - A PAM lockout arrives as `show-error`, with PAM's own text, and is shown
     as is.
7. **The user answers "No" or presses Esc:** the session is cancelled and the
   request completes with `POLKIT_ERROR_CANCELLED`.

### 4.3 Queue and cancellation

- Requests are kept in a FIFO; only the head has a prompt and a session.
- Every request keeps its own `GCancellable`.
  - Cancelled at the head: the session is cancelled, the prompt gets `cancel`
    and the next request starts.
  - Cancelled while waiting: it is just removed from the queue.
- **The prompt crashes or closes its pipe:** this counts as "No" for the
  current request. A crashing UI never leaves polkitd waiting.
- A request withdrawn by polkit completes with `G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED` (GTask
  does that for a cancelled `GCancellable`); polkitd doesn't look at the
  answer to a request it withdrew.

### 4.4 Finding the prompt

The same rule the compositor uses for `vela-session-env`:

1. next to the agent's own executable (the build directory);
2. then `${libexecdir}/vela-polkit-prompt`.

`VELA_POLKIT_PROMPT` overrides it, for the tests.

## 5. Agent ↔ prompt protocol

- **Transport.** The prompt's stdin carries agent → prompt; its stdout
  carries prompt → agent. stderr is inherited and goes to the session log.
- **Format.** One message per line: a word, a space, an argument
  (`polkit/protocol.hpp`, shared by both programs).
  - In the argument, `\` and newline are escaped as `\\` and `\n`.
  - Unknown words are ignored, so either side can grow.

Agent → prompt:

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `action <id>` | polkit action id |
| `message <text>` | the action's message, already translated by polkitd (the agent registers with the user's locale) |
| `icon <name>` | the action's icon name, possibly empty |
| `app <name>` / `app-icon <name or path>` | who is asking (§4.2) |
| `detail <key>=<value>` | one per detail, for "Show more details" |
| `identity <uid> <login> <display name>` | one per identity; the first is selected |
| `avatar <uid> <path>` | optional |
| `show` | everything above has been sent; the prompt appears |
| `request <0\|1> <text>` | PAM asks something; `1` = echo on (e.g. a user name), `0` = password |
| `info <text>` / `error <text>` | PAM messages (fingerprint reader, lockout...) |
| `retry` | wrong answer: clear the field, shake it, say so |
| `failed` | authentication isn't available (§4.2): say so; only "No" is left |
| `done` | authorized: fade out and exit 0 |
| `cancel` | withdrawn by polkit: fade out and exit 0 |

Prompt → agent:

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `identity <uid>` | the user picked another identity; the agent restarts the session for it |
| `response <text>` | the answer to the last `request` |
| `cancel` | "No", Esc or the window was closed |

The password travels once, in a `response` line, over a pipe between two of
the user's own processes. It then goes into `polkit_agent_session_response`.
Both sides overwrite their copy afterwards, as best they can (§9).

## 6. `vela-polkit-prompt`

Qt Quick, with LayerShellQt and `Vela.Controls`. It runs only while a request
is on screen.

### 6.1 Surfaces

- **A veil on every other output.** A layer-shell surface on the `overlay`
  layer (namespace `vela-polkit-veil`), anchored to all edges, with
  `exclusive_zone = -1`.
  - It has no keyboard (`KEYBOARD_INTERACTIVITY_NONE`) but takes every
    pointer event, so nothing underneath can be clicked.
  - It is a translucent dark fill over a full-screen blur
    (`ext-background-effect-v1`): the desktop stays visible and alive behind
    it, but out of reach.
  - Outputs added or removed while the prompt is open get or lose their veil.
- **The dialog.** Another full-screen `overlay` surface (namespace
  `vela-polkit`) with `KEYBOARD_INTERACTIVITY_EXCLUSIVE`: its own veil, and
  the dialog centered on it.
  - It goes on the output under the pointer: the prompt doesn't name an
    output, and the compositor chooses.
  - The prompt learns which output that is when the surface enters it
    (`wl_surface.enter`); the veils then go on all the others. A veil
    created on the wrong guess disappears within a frame or two, while it is
    still almost transparent.
- **Animation.** The veils fade in, and the dialog fades in and grows
  slightly, using the shell's curves and durations. Both fade out on `done`,
  `cancel` or "No", and the process exits only once the fade is over.
  Durations are in milliseconds and don't depend on the refresh rate.

### 6.2 The dialog

The layout follows Windows 11's UAC:

- **Header** with the title "User Account Control" (*Controllo dell'account
  utente*).
- **The question:** "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your
  device?"
- **The app:** icon and name (§4.2). Under them, polkit's message for the
  action, e.g. "Authentication is required to change the system time".
- **"Show more details"** expands to:
  - the action id (polkit doesn't give agents the vendor);
  - the command line (pkexec);
  - the program path;
  - any other details polkit sent.
- **Identity:**
  - the avatar and name of the selected administrator;
  - a picker if there are several identities and the current user is not one
    of them.
- **The PAM prompt**, under the identity:
  - a password field for `request 0`, a plain text field for `request 1`;
  - PAM's own label, if it isn't just "Password:";
  - a Caps Lock warning;
  - `info` and `error` texts.
- **Buttons:** **Yes** (primary, disabled while the field is empty) and
  **No**.

Behavior:

- Enter = Yes, Esc = No, and Tab moves through the dialog.
- The field has focus as soon as the dialog appears.
- While the helper is checking, the buttons are disabled and a small
  indeterminate bar runs.
- A `retry` clears the field, shakes it and says "The password is incorrect.
  Try again."
- A `request` with no password field on screen (e.g. after a fingerprint
  timeout) shows one.
- The dialog never grows past its output. The band with Yes and No stays in
  view and the content above it scrolls. Identities show three and a half at
  most and details 140 px at most, and both scroll. The password field
  scrolls into view when it takes the focus.
- Every text is plain text: app names, polkit's message and PAM's words
  come from outside, and markup in them must not change the dialog.
- Text follows Vela's rules: English in the code, Italian in
  `i18n/vela-polkit-prompt_it.ts`. polkit's own message is already in the
  user's language.

### 6.3 Light and dark, scale

The prompt uses the same Theme as the shell, so it follows light/dark and the
accent color. It is a layer-shell client with fractional-scale and
viewporter, like the shell's panels, and is drawn at the exact scale of its
output. Checked on screenshots at 100% and 125%; an automated sharpness check
of the dialog is still to do (§12).

## 7. Compositor changes

1. **Supervised children** (`struct vela_child`, `process.c`): the shell and
   the agent are restarted by the same code.
   - Exit code 2 from the agent ("another agent is registered") is not
     restarted.
   - The agent gets `SIGTERM`, not `SIGKILL`, when the compositor dies, so it
     unregisters from polkitd.
2. **Who starts the agent.** `VELA_POLKIT_AGENT` names another command, or
   `0` for none. Without it, the agent starts only in a real (DRM) session:
   nested or headless, the logind session belongs to someone else (Plasma
   already has its agent, and a test must never answer polkit for the user).
   `polkit-agent=no` in `vela.conf` leaves the job to another agent. The
   agent is found next to the compositor, then in `libexecdir`.
3. **The modal dialog** (`vela_focus_modal_layer`, `focus.c`): a mapped
   `overlay` surface with exclusive keyboard interactivity.
   - Global bindings are off while it is there: Super, Alt+Tab, Alt+F4,
     Win+D, snapping, desktops... **Exceptions:** switching VT, the
     keyboard's media and volume keys (they act on the player and the volume,
     never on windows, and muting a loud video while typing the password is
     useful), Win+L (locking is always allowed; after unlocking, the dialog
     has the keyboard again) and the developer exit (Alt+Shift+Esc).
   - A keyboard Move/Size in progress ends as with Esc when the dialog takes
     the keyboard, and none can start under it: its keys would swallow the
     password.
   - Neither a window nor a shell panel opening meanwhile takes the keyboard;
     a newer `overlay` surface can.
   - `vela_focus_refocus()` gives the keyboard back to the dialog first (after
     unlocking, or when a panel under it closes).
4. **Stacking.** The `overlay` tree already sits above fullscreen windows and
   above the shell's `top` panels raised over fullscreen.
5. **Tests.** `state` lists the layer-shell surfaces (`layers`) and the one
   with the keyboard (`focusedLayer`).
6. `vela_view_is_system_prompt()` keeps recognizing KDE's agent, for people who disable
   ours.

## 8. `Vela.Controls`

Today `Theme.qml` exists in three copies (shell, Settings, Files). Files also
compiles `MenuPanel.qml` and `PanelShadow.qml` straight from `shell/qml`.

- **The module.** A static QML module, `Vela.Controls`, in `common/`:
  - `Theme` (singleton): Windows 11's Fluent colors and sizes, the same
    values as Settings', plus the veil behind system dialogs;
  - `Button` and `TextBox` (with `password: true`), as in Settings;
  - the C++ singletons `Style` (`Appearance`: light or dark, accent, Mica,
    icon mode; system UI follows the shell's mode, apps their own) and
    `Effects` (`BackgroundEffects`: blur), plus the `image://icon` provider,
    installed with `vela::controls::install()`.
- **The prompt** is its first user.
- **Shell, Settings and Files** move to it in a separate step (§11). Their
  three Themes are not identical today, and merging them deserves its own
  commit and its own screenshots.

## 9. Security notes

What this design protects:

- **The session is the right one** (§4.1).
- **Requests can't be misattributed.** One prompt per request, one session
  per prompt, cancellation by cookie.
- **No other client can take the keyboard while the dialog is up.** That
  means exclusive interactivity plus suppressed shortcuts. Wayland already
  prevents other clients from reading keystrokes.
- **The idle process is small.** No Qt, no QML, no GPU driver. Its inputs
  come from polkitd (root) and from its own child.
- **Test mode can't replace the real agent.** `VELA_POLKIT_TEST_PASSWORD` is
  refused unless the authority on the bus reports itself as the tests' fake
  polkitd (`BackendName` `vela-fake-polkitd`): an address alone could name
  the real system bus.

What it doesn't protect, as with every Linux agent:

- **Another program can draw a look-alike dialog.** The real defense against
  phishing would be a compositor-attested "secure" surface. That is not
  planned; noted as a possible future step.
- **Password memory hygiene is best effort.** The prompt and the agent
  overwrite their buffers. Qt strings, though, can be copied internally, and
  nothing is `mlock`ed. This is the same level as KDE's and GNOME's agents.

## 10. Tests

None of them uses polkitd or PAM.

- **Agent core (GoogleTest, `polkit.*`).** `Agent` runs on a fake backend:
  the prompt is a list of received lines, the PAM session is driven by the
  test. Covered: what the prompt is told, PAM messages, a wrong answer
  retried with a new session, sessions that fail by themselves (no loop),
  "No", a crashed prompt counting as "No", a prompt that doesn't start,
  queueing, polkit withdrawing the active or a waiting request, late events
  from finished requests, choosing another identity, escaping, identity
  order, which program is "asking".
- **Prompt (functional, `test_polkit.py`).** The test starts
  `vela-polkit-prompt` and plays the agent over its stdin/stdout. Covered:
  the answer sent and `done` closing it, `retry`, no second answer while PAM
  is checking, Esc, `cancel` from the agent, a dead agent, `failed`,
  choosing another identity from the keyboard, clicks outside going nowhere,
  a window opening without taking the keyboard, shortcuts off (snap, Alt+F4,
  Alt+Tab) and back on afterwards, a keyboard Move ended by the dialog and
  refused under it, dialog under the pointer and veils on the other outputs.
- **Whole agent (functional, `test_polkit.py`).** The compositor starts the
  real `vela-polkit-agent` (`VELA_POLKIT_AGENT`), which registers with
  `fake_polkitd.py` on a private bus given as `DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS`.
  `VELA_POLKIT_TEST_PASSWORD` replaces PAM with a session accepting one
  password; the agent refuses it unless the authority is the fake one
  (§9). Covered: registration for a `unix-session` in Vela's language,
  authorized after a wrong password, "No", withdrawn by polkit, a crashed
  dialog counting as "No" with the agent going on, two requests queued,
  restarted after a crash, not restarted when another agent owns the
  session, test mode refused against an authority that isn't the fake.
- The whole agent also ran under AddressSanitizer and UBSan through the
  functional tests: no reports.
- **By hand, by the user** (with the correct password only):
  - `pkexec true`;
  - Terminal (Admin), i.e. `run0`;
  - renaming the PC and changing the date in Settings;
  - two `pkexec` at once (queue);
  - Vela from a TTY with Plasma running (right session).

## 11. Stages

| Stage | Content | |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | `Vela.Controls` with what the prompt needs (Theme, buttons, fields, blur); the shell keeps its own files for now | done |
| P1 | `vela-polkit-prompt` and the protocol (§5, §6), with its functional tests driven by the harness | done |
| P2 | `vela-polkit-agent`: registration, requests, queue, cancellation, re-registration after a polkitd restart, unit tests | done |
| P3 | Compositor: list of supervised children, the agent started with the session, the modal dialog keeps keyboard and shortcuts; `vela-session.target` drops `Wants=plasma-polkit-agent.service`; PKGBUILD depends on `polkit` instead of suggesting `polkit-kde-agent` | done |
| P4 | The user tries it for real (§10, "by hand") | |
| P5 | Shell, Settings and Files move to `Vela.Controls` | |

## 12. Open questions and risks

- **Which `polkit.*` details polkitd really sends** (§4.2): to check in P4.
  If the subject pid is missing, the dialog falls back to the action's icon,
  as KDE's does.
- **Re-registration after a polkitd restart** (§4.1) is not covered by the
  tests yet.
- **Sharpness of the dialog** at fractional scales is not checked
  automatically yet (§6.3).
- **Qt Quick cold start.** Starting the prompt costs a few hundred
  milliseconds, partly hidden by the veil's fade-in. If it is too slow, the
  agent can keep one prompt started and hidden. That gives up part of goal 3,
  so only if measurements say so.
- **Several requests from the same app in a row** (e.g. a package manager
  asking for three actions). polkit's `auth_admin_keep` already avoids
  repeated passwords where the action allows it. Nothing to do on our side.
